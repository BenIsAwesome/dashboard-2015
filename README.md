Yea ok so I think I actually think that I have accidentally erased my first change on this file so I am adding text here to help me remember all the things that i need to know.





Shortcut keys important to me:

*** note that the colon symbol has no effect here until you press escape and then you can actually go in and start editing text using the full keyboard.

:i = insert mode  (allows you to go in and edit the file that you have opened up)


to open up the config type:
vim ~/.gitconfig
